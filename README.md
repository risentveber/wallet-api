# wallet-api
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/risentveber/wallet-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/risentveber/wallet-api)

Service stores account balances and provide one with functionality 
of transferring money from one account to another.

## Domain

## Assumptions

- All IDs here are uuid4.
- Term transfer suits better than payment
- No functionality for deposit/withdraw - just inner transfer
- Each transfer consist of one(deposit/withdraw) or two(inner) parts that
are denormalized for better read performance.

## Conventions

- 'USD' and 'usd' means the same, but we use first for inner representation
- for all enums uppercase used
- uuid4 is presented in lowercase

## Questions and features to be considered for future

- Separation for booking and spending for 2-phase transactions
- Pagination for 'all' methods
- Currencies exchange
- Deposit/Withdraw from outside world 
- Additional API methods
- Clearing idempotency keys that are older that 24h e.g.
