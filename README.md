# wallet-api
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/risentveber/wallet-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/risentveber/wallet-api)

Service stores account balances and provide one with functionality 
of transferring money from one account to another.

## Domain

For detailed API documentation see `API.md`.

## Business assumptions

- All IDs here are uuid4.
- Term transfer suits better than payment.
- No functionality for deposit/withdraw - just inner transfer.
- Each transfer consist of one(deposit/withdraw) or two(inner) parts that.
are denormalized for better read performance.
- Transfer amount rounding without any error if there is extra precision specified.

## Business conventions

- 'USD' and 'usd' means the same, but we use first for inner representation.
- Transfer operations positive-idempotent(means after succeeded 
once it will always return 'OK' without duplication).

## Tech assumptions

- Service simplified - there is no prometheus metrics and extra logging.
- It's supposed to run in k8s - there is no service discovery logic.
- For supported configuration flags see `./cmd/api/config.go`.
- When started server tries connect to DB until succeed or 
retries count exceeded(see configuration options).
- To stop server gracefully you need to send `SIGHUP`, and it will try do it
in time specified via configuration.

## Questions and features to be considered for future

- Separation for booking and spending for 2-phase transactions.
- Pagination for 'all' methods.
- Currencies exchange.
- Deposit/Withdraw from outside world.
- Additional API methods.

## How to run code or develop

### Preparations

You need install:
- `docker` and `docker-compose`
- https://taskfile.dev

### Run locally

```bash
task build_dev_tools # builds toolig image
task up # run all in docker compose
# wait some time until PostgreSQL will statred
task migrate # apply migrations inside docker-compose started by task up
task -l # for available tasks for development
```

### Development

Attaches git hooks for running test/linter in development process lifecycle,
also prepending each commit msg with `[<branch_name>] ` prefix for later investigations 
via git blame.
```bash
task attach_hooks
```
After you start and change something modd rebuild and restart app via `./tools/modd.conf`
There is also `./tools/init.sql` file that maybe useful if you decide to populate DB with test data.

### Build Docker image for deployment 

Be aware you need to run migrations (e.g. via k8s job)

```bash
IMAGE_NAME=wallet-api:1.0.0 task build_api_image
```
